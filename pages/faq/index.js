                  Currently, there is no built-in way to set a minimum purchase
                  quantity for a specific product. However, to add a minimum or
                  maximum order total, go to the Store Control Panel, click
                  Settings, and then click Cart & Checkout. Set the minimum or
                  maximum allowed order subtotal. If it is crucial to set a
                  limit on a specific product, you can add the Purchase Quantity
                  app in the Store Control Panel.
